            <h4>Is it a real XMPP server?</h4>
            <p>Yes. You will get your own virtual host on our <a href="https://ejabberd.im" target="_blank">ejabberd</a>
               XMPP server installation.</p>

            <h4>Which XMPP domain will I get?</h4>
            <p>We will use your Nextcloud domain as subdomain of <em>jsxc.ch</em>. For example, if use <em>cloud.mydomain.com</em> for
	    your Nextcloud installation, your XMPP domain will be <em>cloud.jsxc.ch</em>, if that name is still available; otherwise a related name will be chosen, such as <em>cloud-mydomain-com.jsxc.ch</em> or something <em>cloud-9.jsxc.ch</em>, in that order.</p>

            <h4>Can I use other clients?</h4>
            <p>As we said, you will get a full-blown XMPP server and this means you can use every XMPP client.
               Try <a href="http://pidgin.im/" target="_blank">Pidgin</a>, <a href="https://gajim.org/" target="_blank">Gajim</a>
               or <a href="https://github.com/siacs/Conversations" target="_blank">Conversations</a>. Tip: Use app passwords.

            <h4>Is this safe?</h4>
            <p>Sure:</p>
            <ul>
            <li> We do not have access to your Nextcloud data and all XMPP connections from JSXC will use time-limited tokens, so we will not be able to obtain your password.</li>
            <li>If you use a third-party client, we recommend to use app passwords (and disable file access, just in case).</li>
            <li>We use encrypted connections everywhere. In fact, the process of obtaining the certificats for your new XMPP domain take up the largest part of the registration waiting time.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Is this federated and what the hack is federated?</h4>
            <p>Federated means you are able to communicate with every other XMPP user if they support
               server-to-server communication. It is like email and yes, our XMPP server supports this.
               So <em>joe.user@cloud.mydomain.com.jsxc.ch</em> can communicate with
               <em>jane.doe@chinwag.com</em> or any other XMPP-enabled domain, and vice versa.</p>

            <h4>Are there really no constraints?</h4>
            <p>Ok, you caught us. Our service does not yet work if you use email addresses as user IDs in Nextcloud, but we are working on this.</p>
