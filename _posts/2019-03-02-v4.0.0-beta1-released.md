Today we release the first public beta of [JSXC 4.0 core] and [for Nextcloud].
This means we are one step closer to the final release of JSXC 4.0 which brings
a lot of goodies, like [OMEMO, MUC invitation, voice-only calls and
more](https://www.jsxc.org/blog/2018/09/26/v4.0.0-first-alpha-released.html).

There are [108 commits] between this release and the first alpha. We mainly fixed
bugs and caught up to 3.x, but we also provide some enhancements like avatars
for MUC rooms, mute indicator and you can specify your storage backend.

The biggest change was the redesign of our public API. Instead of a function
based approach, you now have to create an JSXC instance to access most of the
functionality. This prevents developers to call functions before JSXC is
initialized, which is specially important for the new storage option, because
virtually every action is using the storage backend. You find an example in our
[installation guide].

As usually we kindly ask everyone to test this release and report issues to our
[tracker] and translate JSXC on [webtranslateit].
