Our first feature release for the 4.x branch is enhancing the multi client
usability tremendously by implementing [XEP-0333: Chat Markers][XEP-0333].
This XMPP extensions allows supported clients to synchronise the read state,
and shows you if someone has received or seen a message. Thanks to @dommaes
who was working on this nice extension.

Through the work of @pussbb you have now the possibility to explain things
during a screen sharing session.

There are plenty of other smaller and bigger features and fixes, which make
the use of JSXC even more pleasant. See the changelog below for more details.

You can download the release as usual from the [JSXC] or [JSXC for Nextcloud]
release page.

A special thank you for all people who contributed code or reported bugs. Thank you.
