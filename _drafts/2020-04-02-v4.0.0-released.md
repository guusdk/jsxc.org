With the release of **JSXC 4.0** a long story comes to an end with a bunch of
long requested features like OMEMO, MUC invitation, voice-only call, JID
escaping, experimental multi account support, and much more. We are really happy
to present you the best version of JSXC since the project was founded in 2013.

With the new release we also deprecate our Github wiki in favour of our [new documentation](https://jsxc.readthedocs.io).
Please feel free to submit changes to the [jsxc/documentation repository](https://github.com/jsxc/documentation);

You can download this release as usual from our [release page](https://github.com/jsxc/jsxc/releases)
or the [nextcloud app store](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/ojsxc). If you like to test the release
without any installation you can use our [release](https://www.jsxc.org/example/) or
[nightly](https://www.jsxc.org/example-nightly/) demo page.

This huge release step will result in a lot of breaking changes, therefore we
will explain briefly in the next section how you can install JSXC 4.0. At the end you
will find a complete changelog, screenshots and a roadmap for the next release.

## Installation
The installation is now quite a bit easier, even if there are not all options available you know from JSXC 3.x.

1. Download and extract the release archive to your web root.
2. Include the following files into your page:
   - `styles/jsxc.bundle.css`
   - `jsxc.bundle.js`
   - JQuery (3.x)
3. If you like to use OMEMO, download [libsignal] and include its `dist/libsignal-protocol.js`.
   JSXC will then automatically detect it upon initialization.
4. Initialize JSXC with `jsxc.init()` and use either `jsxc.start()` or `jsxc.watchForm()`.

Our new API is now much cleaner and encapsulated. This means you can't call
internal functions, like done before. You find more details in our
[API documentation](https://jsxc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html).
